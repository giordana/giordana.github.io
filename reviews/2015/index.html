        <p>After 3 months as RM the ramp up was completed, a new phase begins. </p>

        <p> "For the next year, I really want to achieve my personal goals as an RM and help the people that are involved in the staffing process to have more information, 
		so that consultants trust the process a little bit more and the managers can make good decisions. 
		I want to help others to see different points of view and provide more information to help on their decisions, as PMs, recruiting, MDs, PSM and other RMs. 
		Also help TWers to understand better how they can help on the RM and make things work for them. 
		I also want to improve my communication and influence skills, and start to be <b>part of bigger things</b>. 
		For the long run I can't think of one thing only that I want to do, I'm really liking to work as an RM, and for now I want to <b>focus on RM and do a great work</b>. 
		I want to do <b>something that can make a difference and can continue with or without me</b>, so I know that I can do other things when I feel that I would add more value somewhere else".
