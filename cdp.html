        <h1>March/2013</h1>

        <p>Questioning my career as a QA, <b>what do I need to learn?</b> </p>

        <p>I've being teaching a lot and learning very little, is this it from now on?</p>

        <p>Always the same, no big challenges. I'm <b>bored</b></p>

        <p>QA community is disapointing: QAs tend to be more "quiet" and it's hard to motivate them. (example DevOps
            workshop)</p>

        <p>Hard to grow: people couldn't point technical areas that I needed to improve, only specializations</p>
    </div>
</div>
<!--So I set up goals to help me with some of those things and redirect my focus to things that I could make a difference, so the projects would not be such big problems-->

        <h1>2013 Goals Reviewed</h1>

        <p> &#10003 be more <b>involved in TW</b>, outside project, have <b>bigger impact</b>: Organized NHO, QA
            assessment, participated in code retreat and other events</p>

        <p> &#10003 help new TWers with <b>coaching</b>, as a sponsor, etc: TWU coaching (Bruna), new sponsee (Raquel),
            helping Devs to
            change roles (Bolinha, Jesus), Helping beginner QAs (Natalie)</p>

        <p> &#10003 help the other QAs to improve in technical and consulting skills, share experiences, foster new
            ideas
            and development of them: helped inside my project (Ghisi with business, Ludo, Natalie), organized the QA
            assessment, but since the engagement of the QAs is really hard, I started to try to influence some of them
            individually to act more on this area</p>

        <p> &#10003 help QAs to find their new role in a multifunctional team, teach more people outside the QA role
            about
            QAing: Started with the devs as QAs program, did some changes in Amplify and got more people involved in
            testing. Still
            a long way to go. </p>

        <p> &#10003 start to be seeing as a reference in QA inside of TW Brasil, where people will look for me to get
            advice and help in their projects: I got contacted in US to talk about Spock and Calabash to some people.
            Recently I got
            contact from people in Recife about mobile testing and I was referred to a BA in Quito to start the QA
            process
            in her project. It's happening ;-) </p>

        <p> &#10003 find <b>new challenges</b> while doing a great work as a QA inside the project: did a good job in
            Amplify and became
            RM as my new challenge, also starting to develop software is another big challenge</p>

        <h1>Feedback highlights</h1>
        <h2>Done well</h2>
        <p>I had the opinion that the QAs had to be very technical and work deep with the code and your profile is not that
        technical. You have the technical skills but <b>what made a difference in the project was your close relationship
        with the client and your organization skills</b>. You did a good job working close with the client and understanding
        the business, bringing that to the team and organizing the processes. Now that you are leaving I want another
        Gio - <i> Alexandre Barbosa</i> </p>
        <p>"You helped a lot with the releases, It was really great the way you stayed on top of everything even being far
        away, <b>you are one of the best QAs I've worked with</b>." - <i>Mona Soni (client's QA lead and ex-TWer)</i></p>
        <p>You organize things really well, for instance the NHO and our team meetings. <b>The meetings that you organized
        went really well</b> and it was really good that you always send the meeting notes after. One of the best meetings
        that we have was the showcase that you organized that was really smooth. - <i>Thiago Colucci</i></p>
        <p>I love the staffing updates, <b>Keep rocking</b>. - <i>A lot of people</i></p>
        <p>I admire you very much, you are the person that knows what needs to be done and just do it and do it well. You
        don't mind doing the boring work because you know it needs to be done. <b>Whatching you work like this showed me
        how important is to do the boring and ugly part of the work so you can do the cool stuff better</b>. For instance in
        the case of the release mess, you saw that there was nobody handling and the release process was all confused
        and, even from here, you took over the work and made it happen. It was nice that you were always showing the
        rest of the team the cool work that you were doing so we could all learn from this experiences. You are a
        natural leader and you go beyond your role to help the team. I really liked that you came to me right away when
        my name was mentioned for Jigsaw and you talked to me before taking a decision. - <i>Natalia Arsand</i> </p>
        <p>Got <b>ownership</b> fast and is doing a great job. Get to do <b>extra</b> work that is not part of the job, like helping the
        Jigsaw team and developing things. - <i>Gabriel Notari (Mr President) </i></p>
        <p>Doing a great job, took ownership. Not afraid to <b>question things</b>. Bringing more input form what people want to
        staffing decisions. Really good that you are <b>creating your own tools</b> and working close with the Jigsaw team,
        this can potentiate the impact of the Techops Delivery team in Brasil. - <i>Eduardo Fayh</i></p>

        <h2>To improve</h2>
        <p>The only thing for you to improve was what you mentioned, that you are so passionate when having a discussion
        that this gets in the way, specially in remote meetings. My advice is for you to try to take a step back when
        this happens, and let things to chill out. - <i>Thiago Colucci</i> </p>


        <h2>Future Directions</h2>
        <p>Didn't see any issues yet, but it's good to keep in mind for the future to hold the anxiety and also prepare to
            talk to people to not look fluster. - <i>Gabriel Notari</i></p>
        <p>Build relationship and <b>work closer to the PMs</b>, so they can be the messengers in their projects - Eduardo Fayh</p>
        <p>Look at what the RMs in other regions aer doing and work closer with them - <i>Eduardo Fayh</i></p>
